# Live-Weather-Dashboard
In this project, I built a city-wise weather and AQI monitoring dashboard using real-time data from a web-based API, bypassing static CSVs. The goal was to visualize temperature, humidity, UV index, and air pollutant levels in an accessible format for informed environmental and travel decisions.
