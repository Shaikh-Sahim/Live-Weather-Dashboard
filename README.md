# 🌤️ Live Weather & AQI Dashboard – Power BI Portfolio Project

Welcome to my Power BI portfolio project — a real-time Weather and Air Quality Dashboard. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate live data sources, transform complex JSON into structured models, and design an interactive, auto-refreshing dashboard that visualizes essential weather and pollution metrics.

---

## 🌟 Project Summary

In this project, I built a city-wise weather and AQI monitoring dashboard using real-time data from a web-based API, bypassing static CSVs. The goal was to visualize temperature, humidity, UV index, and air pollutant levels in an accessible format for informed environmental and travel decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Display real-time weather and AQI metrics across multiple Indian cities  
- Parse and model JSON API data directly inside Power BI  
- Provide a fully dynamic and interactive user experience  
- Host the report online with automated daily data refresh  

---

## 💼 My Role & Deliverables

As a Data Analyst, I:

- Connected Power BI to a weather API using Web Connector  
- Parsed and normalized nested JSON data into tabular formats  
- Modeled and related multiple tables for efficient querying  
- Created dynamic visuals for KPIs like temperature, humidity, UV, etc.  
- Integrated AQI pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂) with scale indicators  
- Designed card visuals, color-coded alerts, and responsive weather icons  
- Automated refreshes and published the dashboard to Power BI Service

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

- 💻 Power BI Desktop  
- 🌐 Web API (Live Weather API)  
- 📦 JSON (Parsed using Power Query M)  
- ⚡ DAX for calculations  
- ☁️ Power BI Service (Auto-refresh enabled)

---

## 📌 Key Metrics Visualized

- 🌡️ Temperature  
- 💧 Humidity  
- 🌬️ Wind Speed  
- 🌫️ Visibility  
- ☀️ UV Index  
- 🌦️ Precipitation  
- 🌅 Sunrise/Sunset Time  
- 🏭 AQI: PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂  
- ⚠️ Color-coded AQI severity scale with dynamic suggestions  

---

## ✅ Outcome & Impact

The final dashboard:

- Provides an interactive city-wise view of weather and pollution levels  
- Adapts visuals and values based on user selection  
- Automatically updates without manual data refresh  
- Can be embedded or shared with real-time updates via Power BI Service  

This project improved my skills in API integration, JSON handling, DAX, and dashboard interactivity — all without using any static CSV files.
